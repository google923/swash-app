**Date**: November 14, 2025
**File**: `home.html` (1,535 lines)
**Status**: COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AGAINST ALL 10 REQUIREMENTS

---

## ✅ REQUIREMENT 1: HEADLINE + SUB-HEADLINE + IMMEDIATE CTA (Answers 4 Critical Questions)

### Current Status: ✅ **EXCELLENT** (9/10)

**What's Working:**
- ✅ **Headline**: "Professional Window Cleaning For Homes Across Essex" (clear, specific)
- ✅ **Sub-headline**: "15+ Years of Experience. 5-Star Reviews. Trusted by Hundreds of Homeowners." (builds credibility)
- ✅ **Hero Divider**: Blue 3px divider adds visual separation & premium feel
- ✅ **Primary CTA**: "✨ Get Your Free Instant Quote Today" (compelling, action-oriented)
- ✅ **Hero CTA Section**: Multi-layer trust badges below CTA:
  - "✓ 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed"
  - "⭐ Rated 5-Stars on Google"
  - "🏠 1,000+ Happy Homeowners"

**Critical Questions Answered:**
1. ✅ **Who is this for?** → "Homes Across Essex" (specific geographic + property type)
2. ✅ **Why should they care?** → "15+ Years", "5-Star Reviews", "Trusted by Hundreds" (trust signals)
3. ✅ **What do you do?** → "Professional Window Cleaning" (crystal clear)
4. ✅ **What now?** → "Get Your Free Instant Quote Today" (immediate action)

**Minor Gap:**
- ⚠️ No **YouTube video embedded in hero** yet (will add in next step)
- ⚠️ Video should be immediately visible above fold to maximize engagement

**Recommendation**: Add YouTube video in hero section BEFORE the copy for maximum impact.

---

## ✅ REQUIREMENT 2: ENGAGING, HUMAN VIDEO AT TOP OF PAGE (Answers 4 Critical Questions)

### Current Status: ⚠️ **NEEDS WORK** (3/10)

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ YouTube video not embedded
- ❌ Video section is #2, not hero-integrated
- ❌ No actual video to answer the 4 questions
- ✅ Video section layout exists (responsive, professional styling)
- ✅ Video placeholder is mobile-friendly
- ✅ Thumbnail image applied (swash-clean-window.jpg as background)

**Current Video Section Structure:**
```
Location: Lines 1100-1115
Title: "See The Difference Swash Makes"
Subtitle: "Watch real before-and-after transformations..."
Placeholder: Background image + play button
```

**What Needs to Happen:**
1. Replace video placeholder with **actual YouTube embed** of `https://youtube.com/shorts/tIcxN60vj1Y`
2. Ensure video is **responsive** (works on mobile/desktop)
3. Video should ideally be **in hero section** for above-fold visibility
4. Add context copy explaining what the video shows

**Recommendation**: Embed YouTube video AND move it to hero section (or keep in current position but make it the primary visual element).
